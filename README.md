Sure! Here's a clean and informative `README.md` template for your project based on feature matching and homography estimation using OpenCV:

# Feature Matching and Homography Estimation with OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to detect features, match them between two images, and estimate a homography matrix to align the images. It uses OpenCV's ORB detector and Brute-Force matcher with Hamming distance.

## üì∏ Overview

The steps performed in the script:
1. Load two input images.
2. Detect keypoints and compute descriptors using ORB.
3. Match descriptors using Brute-Force Hamming.
4. Sort and filter matches.
5. Extract corresponding points from matched keypoints.
6. Estimate a homography matrix using RANSAC.
7. Warp one image to align with the other using the homography.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## üß™ How to Run

Make sure you have two images ready (`img1` and `img2`), then run the script:

```bash
python your_script.py
```

Replace `your_script.py` with the filename.

## üîç Key Functions

- `cv2.ORB_create()`: Detects ORB keypoints and descriptors.
- `cv2.DescriptorMatcher_create(cv2.DESCRIPTOR_MATCHER_BRUTEFORCE_HAMMING)`: Brute-Force matcher for binary descriptors.
- `cv2.findHomography()`: Estimates the homography matrix using matched points and RANSAC.
- `cv2.warpPerspective()`: Applies the homography to warp one image onto another.

## üí° Example Use Cases

- Panorama stitching
- Perspective correction
- Augmented reality overlays
- Image alignment in robotics or drone mapping

## üñºÔ∏è Optional: Visualization

The script can also show:
- Matched keypoints before and after filtering
- Warped image result

Add these using:
```python
cv2.imshow("Matches", matched_image)
cv2.imshow("Warped Image", warped_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
